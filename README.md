# Understanding-Causal-Inference
Causal inference is an area of research that focuses on quantifying the impact of a specific intervention.
An alternative perspective on causal inference is that it addresses hypothetical scenarios. The objective is consistently to assess the magnitude of influence resulting from a particular course of action.

### Techniques:
Python 3.9
Pandas

### Conclusion:
There are techniques available to isolate the treatment effect and eliminate the influence of confounders and features. However, it is crucial to incorporate domain knowledge and human inputs in order to properly design the appropriate causal graph and select the suitable methods.
